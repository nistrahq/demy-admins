# Demy Admins App – Android Mobile (Kotlin + Jetpack Compose)

This repository contains the **mobile application** of the **Demy** project, developed in **Kotlin** with **Jetpack Compose**.  
The goal is to provide a modern and accessible Android app for the **target segment of administrators**, aligned with the project’s backend and academic requirements.

---

## Features

- **Modern UI with Jetpack Compose**
- **Persistence with Room** for local offline storage
- **Material Design 3** theming and components
- **Internationalization (i18n)** support for multiple languages
- **Accessibility (a11y)** with compliance to **WCAG** standards
- 100% **Kotlin** (no Java)

## Architecture – MVVM + Modular Design

The project follows **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** combined with **feature-based modularization**.  
Currently, the app is built in a **single Gradle module**, but structured into **feature packages** and **core components**.

```
app/
├─ core/                 # Shared utilities, theme, navigation, resources
└─ features/
   ├─ login/             # Authentication flow
   ├─ home/              # Main administrator dashboard
   ├─ profile/           # Administrator profile and settings
   └─ ...
```

- **UI layer** → Jetpack Compose screens + ViewModels
- **Domain layer** → use cases and business logic
- **Data layer** → repositories, Room, and external API calls
